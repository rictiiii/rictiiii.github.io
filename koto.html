      <section class="case-study-section">
        <div class="section-label">The Challenge</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">Breaking Down User Friction</h2>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>
        <p>Through user research with vehicle owners and analysis of existing automotive service platforms, I identified key pain points:</p>

        <div class="challenge-list">
          <div class="challenge-item">
            <h3>❌ Fragmented Service Experience</h3>
            <p>Vehicle owners had to use multiple apps and websites to schedule maintenance, purchase products, and manage vehicle features. This created friction and reduced engagement with automotive services.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="challenge-item">
            <h3>❌ Complex Booking Flows</h3>
            <p>Traditional service scheduling required phone calls, multiple form submissions, and back-and-forth communication. Users wanted instant booking with transparent pricing and availability.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="challenge-item">
            <h3>❌ Physical Key Limitations</h3>
            <p>Users struggled with managing physical keys—losing them, sharing with family members, or needing spare keys for service appointments. They wanted modern, digital solutions.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="challenge-item">

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <div class="section-label">Design Process</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">From Research to Launch</h2>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <h3>Phase 1: Research & Discovery</h3>
        <p>I conducted comprehensive research to understand user needs and competitive landscape:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>User interviews:</strong> Spoke with 20 vehicle owners across different demographics and vehicle types</li>
          <li><strong>Service provider interviews:</strong> Interviewed automotive service centers to understand operational constraints</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive analysis:</strong> Evaluated existing solutions like Tesla app, Mileiq, Openbay, and YourMechanic</li>
          <li><strong>Technical research:</strong> Investigated digital key standards (Apple CarKey, Android Digital Key)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Key Research Insights:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Users wanted price transparency before committing to services—hidden fees were the #1 complaint about traditional shops</li>
          <li>Convenience was valued over minor cost differences—users would pay 10-15% more for easier booking</li>
          <li>Digital key adoption was hindered by security concerns—needed clear communication about encryption and authentication</li>
          <li>Service recommendations based on mileage/time were highly valued but rarely available in existing platforms</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 2: Information Architecture & User Flows</h3>
        <p>I mapped out comprehensive user journeys for both primary features:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Created detailed flow diagrams distinguishing native app features from web-based e-commerce</li>
          <li>Designed onboarding survey to balance data collection with user patience</li>
          <li>Prototyped checkout flow optimizations through iterative wireframing</li>
          <li>Mapped digital key sharing scenarios (family, valet, service center) to identify edge cases</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 3: Visual Design & Prototyping</h3>
        <p>I established a design system optimized for automotive context:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Dark theme interface:</strong> Matches automotive interior lighting and reduces glare for in-car usage</li>
          <li><strong>High-contrast UI:</strong> Ensures readability in bright outdoor environments (parking lots)</li>
          <li><strong>Large touch targets:</strong> Optimized for one-handed operation and winter glove usage</li>
          <li><strong>Component library:</strong> Reusable patterns for service cards, appointment slots, and booking flows</li>
          <li><strong>Responsive web design:</strong> Ensured e-commerce experience works across desktop, tablet, and mobile web</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Phase 4: Testing & Iteration</h3>
        <p>Rigorous testing ensured both features met user needs and technical requirements:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Usability testing:</strong> Conducted moderated sessions with 12 participants across age groups</li>
          <li><strong>Field testing:</strong> Digital key functionality tested in real-world scenarios (parking lots, valets, service centers)</li>
          <li><strong>A/B testing:</strong> Tested checkout flow variations to optimize conversion rates</li>
          <li><strong>Beta program:</strong> Ran 8-week beta with 100 users and 5 partnered service centers</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Key Iterations:</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Simplified onboarding survey from 8 questions to 4 after observing drop-off</li>
          <li>Added price comparison feature after beta users requested ability to evaluate service costs</li>
          <li>Implemented proximity-based auto-unlock after field testing showed tap-to-unlock was too slow</li>
          <li>Redesigned service cards to emphasize availability and pricing (initially too text-heavy)</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="case-study-section">
        <div class="section-label">Key Learnings</div>
        <h2 class="section-title">What I Learned</h2>
        <div class="section-divider"></div>

        <div class="learning-item">
          <h3>Hybrid Architecture Enables Best of Both Worlds</h3>
          <p>The decision to use native app for core features (digital key, notifications) while embedding web views for e-commerce provided optimal performance and development flexibility. Native features felt fast and integrated, while web content allowed rapid iteration without app store submission delays. This architectural choice reduced development time by 40% compared to pure native approach.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-item">
          <h3>Transparency Builds Trust in Automotive Services</h3>
          <p>Clear, upfront pricing was the single most impactful factor in driving service bookings. Users consistently mentioned price transparency as their favorite feature. This taught me that in traditionally opaque industries (automotive, healthcare, legal), showing pricing before commitment can be a massive competitive advantage.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="learning-item">
          <h3>Digital Key Security Must Be Visible</h3>
          <p>Initial designs treated digital key functionality as "just working" without explaining security measures. User testing revealed significant hesitation to use the feature without understanding encryption, authentication, and backup procedures. Adding a one-time security explainer during first key setup increased adoption by 35%. The lesson: for trust-critical features, transparency about how security works is essential.</p>

          <h3>Service Integration Creates Sticky Experiences</h3>
          <p>Users who utilized both the shop and digital key features had 3x higher retention than those using only one feature. The integration between booking a service and automatically granting digital key access to the service center created a seamless experience that felt magical. This validated that connected ecosystems create more value than isolated features.</p>

          <h3>Automotive Context Requires Design Considerations</h3>
          <p>Designing for in-car and parking lot usage required different thinking than typical mobile apps. High-contrast UI for outdoor visibility, large touch targets for winter gloves, and proximity-based unlock for hands full of groceries were all contextual considerations that emerged from field testing. This taught me to always consider the physical environment where the product will be used.</p>

        <h2>Reflection</h2>
        <p>Koto represents a successful integration of e-commerce and connected car technology into a unified automotive ownership platform. By focusing on real user pain points—opaque pricing, inconvenient scheduling, physical key management—we created an experience that meaningfully improved how people interact with automotive services.</p>

        <p>The success metrics—45% increase in bookings, 82% digital key adoption, 3.5x faster checkout—validate that when you reduce friction in traditionally cumbersome processes (service scheduling, vehicle access), users eagerly adopt digital solutions.</p>

        <p>What I'm most proud of is the seamless integration between e-commerce and digital key functionality. Rather than feeling like two separate features, they work together cohesively—booking a service automatically handles key sharing, appointments appear in the calendar alongside key access permissions, and service history informs future recommendations.</p>

        <h3>Future Opportunities</h3>
        <p>If I were to continue evolving Koto, I'd focus on three key areas:</p>

        <ul>
          <li><strong>Predictive maintenance alerts:</strong> Leverage vehicle diagnostic data to proactively recommend services before issues become critical</li>
          <li><strong>Service provider marketplace:</strong> Open the platform to third-party service providers with quality ratings and competitive bidding</li>
          <li><strong>Fleet management features:</strong> Extend the platform to support multi-vehicle households and small business fleets</li>
          <li><strong>Insurance integration:</strong> Connect service history with insurance providers to offer usage-based discounts for well-maintained vehicles</li>
        </ul>
