# Design Principles

Based on the design system from williamle.design

## Core Philosophy

### 1. Dark-Forward Minimalism
The design embraces darkness as its foundation, creating a sophisticated and modern aesthetic that emphasizes content through high contrast and intentional use of negative space.

### 2. Content Clarity First
Every design decision prioritizes readability and content hierarchy. Typography, spacing, and contrast work together to guide users through information effortlessly.

### 3. Responsive-First Approach
Designs are built mobile-first, with thoughtful adaptations for larger screens. Breakpoints are strategic, not arbitrary, ensuring optimal experiences across all devices.

### 4. Systematic Consistency
A rigorous system of design tokens ensures visual consistency across all components. Colors, spacing, and typography follow predictable patterns that create familiarity and trust.

### 5. Performance-Conscious Design
Animations and interactions are optimized for performance using `will-change` properties and hardware-accelerated transforms. Every visual effect serves a purpose.

### 6. Subtle Sophistication
Rather than flashy effects, the design system relies on subtle refinements: careful spacing, thoughtful typography choices, and gentle hover states that enhance without overwhelming.

## Design Values

**Clarity over Complexity**
Simple, clear interfaces that don't require explanation.

**Consistency over Novelty**
Familiar patterns that users can rely on across the experience.

**Quality over Quantity**
Every element earns its place through purpose and function.

**Accessibility through Contrast**
High contrast ratios ensure content is readable for all users.

**Maintainability through System**
CSS custom properties and systematic naming make the design system sustainable and scalable.
