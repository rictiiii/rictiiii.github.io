          <div class="section-label">Problem</div>
          <h2 class="section-title">Merchants in Different States Need Different Experiences</h2>
          <div class="section-divider"></div>

          <h3>The Business Challenge</h3>
          <p>SkyTab merchants exist in vastly different states throughout their lifecycle—from pre-launch setup to mature operations—yet the MX Hub interface treated all merchants the same. This one-size-fits-all approach created friction, confusion, and missed opportunities for engagement at critical moments.</p>

          <p><strong>Three distinct merchant states required different experiences:</strong></p>

          <h4>🚀 State 1: Merchant is Launching</h4>
          <p>Merchants preparing for launch need to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete basic setup requirements</li>
            <li>Access critical launching information (scheduled install date, menu programming status)</li>
            <li>Connect with their Customer Success Manager (CSM)</li>
            <li>Handle pre-launch activities (rescheduling, file uploads, CSM coordination)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Pain Point:</strong> No clear path to required actions; launching information scattered and hard to find</p>

          <h4>⚙️ State 2: Merchant Just Completed Setup (Pre-live)</h4>
          <p>Merchants who completed required setup but haven't gone live yet need to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Complete additional feature configuration</li>
            <li>Learn about the SkyTab system through tutorials</li>
            <li>Stay informed about SkyTab releases</li>
            <li>Prepare for launch day</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Pain Point:</strong> No dashboard data available yet, but interface didn't guide merchants on what to do next</p>

          <h4>📊 State 3: Merchant Has Been Live</h4>
          <p>Established merchants with operational systems need to:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Access real-time data and dashboards</li>
            <li>Set up new features as they're released</li>
            <li>Configure features their business newly needs</li>
            <li>Continue learning about system capabilities</li>
            <li>Stay updated on releases</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Pain Point:</strong> Dashboard existed but lacked depth; feature discovery was poor; status indicators missing</p>

          <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
          <p>By creating a state-aware system that adapts to merchant lifecycle stages, we could:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reduce cognitive load by showing only relevant information</li>
            <li>Accelerate time-to-value for new merchants</li>
            <li>Improve feature adoption across all merchant segments</li>
            <li>Create a more engaging, helpful experience that grows with the merchant</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="section-label">Design Strategy</div>
          <h2 class="section-title">Creating State-Aware Experiences</h2>
          <div class="section-divider"></div>

          <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>

          <div class="highlight-grid">
            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h4>1. State-Aware, Not State-Gated</h4>
              <p>The interface adapts to merchant state but never blocks access to information. Merchants can always explore, but we guide them to what matters now.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h4>2. Progressive Disclosure</h4>
              <p>Surface critical information first, then layer in additional capabilities as merchants are ready for them.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h4>3. Build Confidence Early</h4>
              <p>Especially for launching merchants, every interaction should reduce anxiety and build confidence in the system.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
              <h4>4. Data as Engagement</h4>
              <p>For live merchants, make data instantly useful and actionable, not just informative.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Research & Discovery</h3>

          <div class="case-study-image">

              Affinity mapping helped identify patterns across merchant segments and prioritize features for each state
            </div>
          </div>

          <h3>Strategic Decisions</h3>

          <h4>Multi-State Wizard System</h4>
          <p>Created a dynamic wizard that changes content, tone, and actions based on merchant lifecycle state:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Pre-launch:</strong> Task-oriented with deadlines and CSM information</li>
            <li><strong>Pre-live:</strong> Education-focused with system tutorials</li>
            <li><strong>Live:</strong> Dashboard-first with feature discovery</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>UI Refresh Rationale</h4>

          <p><strong>Updated Tile Ordering:</strong> Reorganized information hierarchy to prioritize actions over information, placing urgent tasks at the top and contextual resources lower.</p>

          <p><strong>Merged Intro Screens:</strong> Combined redundant welcome flows into a single, contextual welcome that adapts to merchant state. This reduced initial clicks and got merchants to value faster.</p>

          <p><strong>Illustration Background Changes:</strong> Moved from generic backgrounds to state-specific illustrations that reinforce where merchants are in their journey—creating visual continuity and recognition.</p>

          <p><strong>Removed Tooltips:</strong> Eliminated tooltips in favor of clearer labels and in-context help. Tooltips were masking poor information architecture; better organization eliminated the need for explanatory overlays.</p>

          <h4>Illustration System (Collaboration with Trey Ingram)</h4>
          <p>Worked with illustrator Trey Ingram to develop a cohesive illustration system that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Visually represents each merchant state</li>
            <li>Uses consistent style and color language</li>
            <li>Feels professional yet approachable</li>
            <li>Works across different screen sizes</li>
          </ul>

        <section class="content-section">
          <div class="section-label">Impact & Results</div>
          <h2 class="section-title">Measurable Business Impact</h2>
          <div class="section-divider"></div>

          <h3>Business Impact</h3>

          <h4>Scale & Merchant Success</h4>
          <p>Since launch, the redesigned Launch Center has successfully onboarded <strong>11,000+ merchants</strong> through the state-aware system. This demonstrates that the multi-state approach not only works at scale but enables the business to grow merchant onboarding capacity without proportionally increasing support overhead.</p>

          <h4>Onboarding Efficiency</h4>
          <p>Reduced order confirmation time by <strong>4.7 days</strong>, directly accelerating time-to-revenue for both merchants and the business. This improvement came from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clearer task prioritization showing merchants exactly what's needed</li>
            <li>Better CSM integration reducing back-and-forth communication delays</li>
            <li>Streamlined file upload and menu programming workflows</li>
            <li>Proactive error handling that prevents delays from escalating</li>
          </ul>
          <p>This 4.7-day reduction multiplied across 11,000+ merchants represents significant business value in accelerated revenue realization and improved merchant satisfaction during the critical pre-launch period.</p>

          <h4>Feature Adoption & Revenue Impact</h4>
          <p><strong>18,000+ Value-Added Service (VAS) features</strong> adopted by merchants in 2025 alone. This metric demonstrates the success of the state-aware feature discovery system:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Live merchants discovered features through the enhanced dashboard feature hub</li>
            <li>Pre-live merchants explored optional features during the education phase</li>
            <li>The "New" badge system drove awareness of recently released capabilities</li>
          </ul>
          <p>VAS feature adoption directly impacts recurring revenue, as many of these features represent additional monetization opportunities. The state-aware design made feature discovery contextual rather than overwhelming, leading to higher activation rates.</p>

          <h4>Product Quality & Stability</h4>
          <p>Maintained exceptional product quality with <strong>283 bugs resolved</strong> and only <strong>29 remaining open</strong>, achieving a 90% resolution rate. More importantly, <strong>bug resolution velocity exceeds the rate of new bug reports</strong>, indicating:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>A stable, well-architected system</li>
            <li>Comprehensive error state handling that prevents issues from reaching production</li>
            <li>Strong collaboration between design and engineering resulting in fewer implementation gaps</li>
            <li>Proactive quality management that addresses issues faster than they accumulate</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>By the Numbers: Total Impact</h3>
          <p>The redesigned MX Hub Launch Center has proven its value across multiple dimensions:</p>

              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>What This Means:</strong></p>
            <p>The 4.7-day reduction across 11,000+ merchants equals <strong>51,700+ total days saved</strong> in the onboarding process—time that translates directly to faster revenue realization and reduced merchant frustration during their critical launch period.</p>
            <p>With 18,000+ VAS feature adoptions across 11,000+ merchants, we're seeing an average of <strong>1.6 additional features</strong> adopted per merchant—representing significant incremental revenue and demonstrating that the state-aware approach successfully drives feature discovery without overwhelming users.</p>

          <h3>What Worked Well</h3>

          <h4>1. State-Aware Architecture</h4>
          <p>Designing for multiple states from the beginning, rather than bolting it on later, created a more cohesive system. The investment in mapping all states and transitions paid off in a more logical, predictable experience.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> This architectural decision enabled the system to scale to 11,000+ merchants while maintaining clarity and reducing cognitive load—proving that complexity handled at the system level creates simplicity at the user level.</p>

          <h4>2. Collaboration with Illustration</h4>
          <p>Working closely with Trey Ingram on illustrations wasn't just about making things pretty—it was about creating visual anchors that helped merchants understand their journey. The illustrations became a communication tool, not just decoration.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Visual continuity across states helped merchants orient themselves, reducing confusion during transitions and contributing to the overall onboarding efficiency gains.</p>

          <h4>3. Error State Prioritization</h4>
          <p>Spending significant time on error states early prevented future technical debt. By designing comprehensive error handling upfront, we avoided the common pattern of "happy path design" that breaks down in real-world usage.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> This focus on resilience contributed to our 90% bug resolution rate and the fact that resolution velocity exceeds new bug reports—the system was designed to handle problems gracefully from day one.</p>

          <h4>4. Real Data Integration</h4>
          <p>For live merchants, using real data in the dashboard (not just dummy data) was crucial. It validated the design decisions and revealed opportunities we wouldn't have seen with fake numbers.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Data-driven insights helped drive the 18,000+ VAS feature adoptions by making the value of additional features immediately visible and contextual to each merchant's actual business performance.</p>

          <h4>5. Streamlined Task Prioritization</h4>
          <p>Reorganizing tile order and merging redundant intro screens created a more focused, action-oriented experience that guided merchants to what mattered most.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> These seemingly small UX improvements contributed significantly to the 4.7-day reduction in order confirmation time—proving that information architecture and task prioritization have measurable business impact.</p>

          <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
          <p>The most important lesson from this project: <strong>Design for the user's context, not your convenience.</strong> It would have been easier to create one dashboard for all merchants, but it wouldn't have been better. By investing in understanding merchant lifecycle stages and adapting the experience accordingly, we created a system that truly serves merchants where they are—not where we wish they were.</p>

          <p>The results validate this approach: 11,000+ merchants successfully onboarded, 4.7 days saved per merchant, and 18,000+ features adopted. These aren't just impressive numbers—they represent real merchants who got to their "aha moment" faster, opened their businesses sooner, and discovered capabilities that help them succeed.</p>

          <p>Great design meets users in their moment of need. This project reinforced that personalization isn't just about adding someone's name to the screen—it's about understanding their goals, constraints, and context, then designing an experience that helps them succeed. When you get that right, the business impact follows.</p>
