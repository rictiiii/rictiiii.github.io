          <h2>Problem</h2>

          <h3>The Business Challenge</h3>
          <p>Restaurants using SkyTab POS lacked a modern self-ordering solution, forcing customers to wait in long lines and rely on staff-entered orders. This created operational bottlenecks, order accuracy issues, and limited payment flexibility—directly impacting customer satisfaction and restaurant efficiency.</p>

          <p><strong>Three critical pain points emerged:</strong></p>

          <h4>⏳ Efficiency</h4>
          <p><strong>Long lines and wait times</strong> that negatively impacted customer satisfaction and table turnover rates. Peak hours created significant bottlenecks, frustrating both customers and staff.</p>

          <h4>⚠️ Accuracy</h4>
          <p><strong>Order errors due to manual input by staff</strong>, leading to inefficiency, delays, and increased food waste. Miscommunication between customers and staff resulted in incorrect orders and remakes.</p>

          <h4>💳 Flexibility</h4>
          <p><strong>Lack of flexibility in payment methods</strong>, limiting customer convenience and creating friction at the point of sale. Customers expected modern payment options but were constrained by traditional POS limitations.</p>

          <h3>The Opportunity</h3>
          <p>By creating an integrated self-ordering kiosk solution that connects seamlessly with SkyTab POS, we could:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Empower customers to control their ordering experience</li>
            <li>Reduce wait times and improve throughput during peak hours</li>
            <li>Eliminate order errors caused by miscommunication</li>
            <li>Provide flexible payment options (register or kiosk payment)</li>
            <li>Free up staff to focus on food preparation and customer service</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Research & Discovery</h2>

          <h3>Understanding the Problem Space</h3>

          <h4>Stakeholder Interviews & Merchant Feedback</h4>
          <p>I gathered insights from restaurant operators and end users to understand pain points with existing kiosk solutions. Key findings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Merchants wanted <strong>faster throughput</strong> during lunch and dinner rushes</li>
            <li>Customers felt <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by complicated multi-screen ordering flows</li>
            <li>Staff struggled with <strong>kiosk maintenance</strong> and troubleshooting when customers got stuck</li>
            <li>Loyalty program integration was <strong>critical</strong> for repeat customers</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Competitive Analysis</h4>
          <p>Reviewed industry standards and competitors (DoorDash, Uber Eats, McDonald's kiosks) to evaluate common practices:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best practices:</strong> Large touch targets, visual menu categories, clear cart summaries</li>
            <li><strong>Pain points:</strong> Too many steps, unclear navigation, poor error handling</li>
            <li><strong>Opportunity:</strong> SkyTab could offer a <strong>streamlined experience</strong> with fewer screens and clearer visual hierarchy</li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Hardware Constraints & Opportunities</h4>
          <p>Collaborated with the hardware team to understand the Advantech UTK-615 kiosk specifications:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Screen size & resolution:</strong> Optimize layouts for 15" touchscreen at specific resolution</li>
            <li><strong>Touch responsiveness:</strong> Ensure buttons were large enough for accurate taps</li>
            <li><strong>Physical placement:</strong> Design for standing users at counter height</li>
            <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Consider reach zones and readability from various heights</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Key Insights</h3>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Speed is paramount:</strong> Every additional tap or screen adds friction. Customers want to order quickly and get back to their day.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual first:</strong> High-quality food photography drives decisions more than text descriptions. Show, don't just tell.</li>
            <li><strong>Error recovery matters:</strong> When customers make mistakes, they should be able to fix it easily without starting over.</li>
            <li><strong>Loyalty integration is expected:</strong> Regular customers expect their loyalty rewards to be seamlessly integrated.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment flexibility drives adoption:</strong> Offering both "pay at kiosk" and "pay at counter" options accommodates different preferences.</li>
          </ol>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Design Strategy</h2>

          <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>1. Minimal Screens, Maximum Clarity</h4>
            <p>Every screen should have a single, clear purpose. Reduce cognitive load by presenting only essential information and actions at each step.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>2. Touch-First Design</h4>
            <p>Optimize all interactions for touch: large tap targets (minimum 44×44pt), clear visual feedback, and forgiving hit areas. No hover states or small buttons.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>3. Visual Hierarchy Drives Speed</h4>
            <p>Use size, color, and imagery strategically to guide users through the flow. The most important action should be the most visually prominent.</p>
          </div>

          <div class="highlight-box">
            <h4>4. Fail Gracefully</h4>
            <p>Anticipate errors and provide clear, actionable guidance for recovery.</p>
          </div>

          <h3>Strategic Decisions</h3>

          <h4>Streamlined User Flow</h4>
          <p>Designed a linear flow with strategic decision points:</p>
          <ol>
            <li><strong>Loyalty check</strong> (if applicable) → personalized welcome</li>
            <li><strong>Dine-in or To-Go</strong> → sets fulfillment expectations</li>
            <li><strong>Menu browsing</strong> → category navigation with visual cards</li>
            <li><strong>Item customization</strong> → modifiers presented clearly</li>
            <li><strong>Cart review</strong> → opportunity to edit before checkout</li>
            <li><strong>Customer info</strong> (name/phone) → for order tracking</li>
            <li><strong>Payment choice</strong> → kiosk or counter payment</li>
            <li><strong>Confirmation</strong> → order submitted successfully</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This flow reduced the average number of screens from 12+ (competitor average) to 8-10 screens depending on customization needs.</p>

          <h4>Feature Prioritization for MVP</h4>

          <p><strong>Must-Have (MVP):</strong></p>

            <li>Multilingual support</li>
            <li>Accessibility enhancements</li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <div class="divider"></div>

        <section class="content-section">
          <h2>Design Process</h2>

          <h3>Phase 1: User Flow Mapping</h3>
          <p>Mapped out the key user journeys, ensuring a straightforward and intuitive process from welcome to order completion. Created flowcharts showing:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Happy path:</strong> Smooth ordering with no errors or changes</li>
            <li><strong>Loyalty member path:</strong> Personalized experience with points and offers</li>
            <li><strong>Error scenarios:</strong> Payment failure, item unavailable, timeout</li>
            <li><strong>Edit flows:</strong> Changing quantity, modifying items, removing from cart</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 2: Wireframing & Concept Testing</h3>
          <p>Created initial wireframes that simplified the user interface, focusing on <strong>minimal screens and taps</strong> for faster order completion.</p>
          <p><strong>Key decisions from wireframing:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-column menu layout</strong> instead of grid allowed larger touch targets</li>
            <li><strong>Persistent cart widget</strong> in corner provided constant order visibility</li>
            <li><strong>Category pills</strong> at top enabled quick category switching</li>
            <li><strong>Floating action button</strong> (Checkout) remained accessible throughout browsing</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 3: High-Fidelity Design & Prototyping</h3>
          <p>Developed interactive prototypes using Figma to simulate the kiosk experience:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Created actual-size artboards</strong> matching the 15" kiosk dimensions</li>
            <li><strong>Added touch interactions</strong> with tap animations and state changes</li>
            <li><strong>Simulated payment flows</strong> including card reader interactions</li>
            <li><strong>Designed for outdoor lighting</strong> (higher contrast for visibility)</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 4: Iteration Based on Feedback</h3>
          <p>Based on internal feedback and usability testing with merchants and customers:</p>

          <p><strong>Iteration 1: Simplified text instructions</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Original: "Please select your preferred cheese option from the list below"</li>
            <li>Improved: "Cheese — Select at least 1"</li>
            <li>Result: Faster comprehension, less reading required</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Iteration 2: Optimized button sizes</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Increased modifier buttons from 60×60px to 80×80px</li>
            <li>Added more spacing between options (16px → 24px)</li>
            <li>Result: 40% reduction in mis-taps during testing</li>
          </ul>

          <p><strong>Iteration 3: Enhanced cart visibility</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Made cart summary expandable from minimized state</li>
            <li>Added item count badge on cart icon</li>
            <li>Showed running total continuously</li>
            <li>Result: Users felt more confident about their order</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Phase 5: Collaboration & Handoff</h3>
          <p><strong>With Product Management:</strong> Aligned on MVP scope, prioritized features, defined success metrics</p>
          <p><strong>With Engineering:</strong> Created detailed specs, documented edge cases, participated in sprint planning, conducted QA reviews</p>
          <p><strong>With Hardware Team:</strong> Ensured design worked within hardware constraints, tested on actual kiosk hardware</p>

          <h2>Learnings & Reflections</h2>

          <h3>What Worked Well</h3>

          <h4>1. Hardware-First Design Approach</h4>
          <p>Designing specifically for the Advantech UTK-615 hardware from day one—rather than adapting a mobile design—resulted in a more natural, optimized experience.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Zero hardware-related design revisions post-launch. Interactions felt natural and responsive from day one.</p>

          <h4>2. Ruthless Scope Management</h4>
          <p>Resisting feature creep and focusing on MVP essentials allowed us to launch quickly and iterate based on real usage data.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> MVP delivered on schedule. Post-launch data informed Phase 2 priorities more effectively.</p>

          <h4>3. Dual Payment Option</h4>
          <p>Initially, stakeholders wanted kiosk-only payment. I advocated for the "pay at counter" option based on research showing adoption barriers.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> 20% adoption increase validated the decision. Many "pay at counter" users later converted to "pay at kiosk."</p>

          <h4>4. Visual-First Menu Design</h4>
          <p>Investing in high-quality food photography and large imagery paid dividends. Users browsed faster and ordered more confidently.</p>
          <p><em>Impact:</em> Reduced order abandonment and increased average order value.</p>

          <h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
          <p>The most important lesson from this project: <strong>Context-specific design beats platform-agnostic design.</strong> A kiosk is not a large phone or a small tablet—it's a unique form factor with unique use cases. Designing specifically for this context resulted in a more intuitive and efficient experience.</p>

          <p>The 30% reduction in order time validates that <strong>designing for the moment matters</strong>. Customers at a kiosk want speed and confidence, not exploration or delight. Meeting users in their moment of need with a focused, efficient experience drove measurable business impact.</p>
